        "Q1. Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal of doing this might be to use different names for the same module, aliasing it for convenience or avoiding name clashes. It can also be beneficial when you want to organize the code by grouping related functions or classes from the same module under different names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Some characteristics of a module in Python are:\n",
        "- A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.\n",
        "- It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python programs.\n",
        "- Modules provide code reusability and promote better organization of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. To avoid circular importing and its associated issues, you can refactor the code to break the circular dependency by moving the common elements that cause the circularity to a separate module. By doing this, you can ensure that the modules do not depend on each other directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. In Python, the `__all__` attribute is a list that defines what symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) will be imported when using the wildcard `from module import *` syntax. It allows you to control what is exposed to the user when they import your module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. The `__name__` attribute refers to the name of the current module. When the module is the main program being executed, the `__name__` attribute will be set to `'__main__'`. This is useful to conditionally execute certain code when the module is run as the main program versus being imported as a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Attaching a program counter to the RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) interpreter application helps keep track of the current instruction or line being executed. It enables the interpreter to execute the script line by line, maintaining the proper sequence and handling loops or conditional statements correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. To make a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, you would need the following minimum expressions or statements:\n",
        "- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)\n",
        "- Stack manipulation (push, pop)\n",
        "- Conditionals (if, else)\n",
        "- Loops (for, while)\n",
        "- Input and output operations (read, write)\n",
        "- Functions (def, call)\n",
        "- Variables and data storage (assignment, storage)"
