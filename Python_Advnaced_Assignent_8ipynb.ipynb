The steps involved in matching class-based exceptions to handlers are as follows:\n",

Each except block specifies a particular exception class that it can handle. If the raised exception matches the specified exception class (or is a subclass of it), Python enters the corresponding except block to handle the exception.\n",

        "Handling the Exception: Once a matching except block is found, the code inside that block is executed. This is where the exception is handled, and any necessary actions can be taken to address the exceptional condition.\n",

        "Optional finally Block: The finally block (if present) is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is often used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources."
