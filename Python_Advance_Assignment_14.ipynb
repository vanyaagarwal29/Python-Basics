        "The assignment operator `+=` is not just for show; it serves a specific purpose. It is a shorthand for performing addition and assignment in a single step. Using `+=` can lead to faster results at runtime compared to using separate addition and assignment operators. The reason is that `+=` can often take advantage of in-place addition, which modifies the value of the variable directly, without creating a new object.\n",

Function pointers are used in C/C++ to achieve some level of similar behavior, but it is not as natural and straightforward as in Python.\n",

        "- Wrapper: A \"wrapper\" is a function that provides additional functionality to the wrapped feature without altering its source code. The wrapper function usually calls the wrapped feature (original function) and adds some extra processing before or after the call.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decorator: A \"decorator\" is a design pattern in Python that allows you to dynamically modify the behavior of functions or methods using other functions. A decorator is essentially a wrapper that applies to the wrapped feature by using the `@decorator_name` syntax. It allows you to add reusable and flexible behavior to functions without modifying their code directly.\n",

Unlike normal functions that compute and return all values at once, generators produce values on-the-fly, only when requested by the caller. This lazy evaluation approach allows generators to work efficiently with large or infinite sequences of data without consuming excessive memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "By producing values one at a time, generators save memory and computation time, making them well-suited for processing large datasets, streaming data, or any situation where it is not practical to store the entire sequence in memory at once. Additionally, generators allow for more efficient use of resources and can significantly improve the performance of programs dealing with large datasets."
