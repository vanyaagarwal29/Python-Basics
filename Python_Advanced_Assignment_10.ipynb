        "Both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods in Python that are related to attribute access, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `__getattr__(self, name)`:\n",
        "   - `__getattr__` is a special method that is called when an attribute is accessed, but that attribute is not found in the object's dictionary (i.e., it is not an instance attribute).\n",
        "   - It provides a way to define custom behavior for attribute access when the attribute is not directly present in the object.\n",
        "   - This method takes two arguments: `self` (the instance of the object) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
        "   - You can use this method to dynamically generate or calculate attribute values, or to provide default values for missing attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Example:\n",
        "       def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
        "           # Custom behavior when the attribute is not found\n",

        "   print(obj.some_attribute)  # Output: \"Attribute 'some_attribute' not found.\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `__getattribute__(self, name)`:\n",
        "   - `__getattribute__` is a special method that is called every time an attribute is accessed on the object, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not.\n",
        "   - It is a more powerful method than `__getattr__`, but also more dangerous, as it can potentially cause infinite recursion if not handled properly.\n",
        "   - This method takes two arguments: `self` (the instance of the object) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
        "   - You can use this method to intercept and customize attribute access for all attributes of the object. However, you need to be cautious and avoid direct attribute access within `__getattribute__` to prevent infinite recursion.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Example:\n",
        "       def __init__(self):\n",

        "   print(obj.some_attribute)  # Output: \"Custom behavior\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the main difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` is the timing of their invocation and the scope of customization they provide. `__getattr__` is called only when an attribute is not found, allowing you to customize behavior for missing attributes. On the other hand, `__getattribute__` is called for all attribute access and allows you to customize behavior for all attributes, but you need to handle it carefully to avoid unintended side effects."
