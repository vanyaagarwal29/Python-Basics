The try block encloses the code that may raise exceptions, and one or more except blocks follow it, each specifying the type of exception it can handle.\n",

The finally block allows you to specify a set of statements that will be executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup or finalization tasks, such as releasing resources, closing files, or network connections."
