        "In Python, everything is an object, including classes. A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of other classes (i.e., it is the \"class of a class\"). It controls how a class is created, instantiated, and behaves. Metaclasses allow you to customize the behavior of classes at the time of their creation. They provide a powerful way to modify class attributes, methods, and other aspects of class behavior.\n",

        "Q2. Best way to declare a class's metaclass:\n",
        "To declare a metaclass for a class, you need to set the `__metaclass__` attribute of the class. However, using the `__metaclass__` attribute is an older approach, and it is generally recommended to use the `metaclass` keyword argument in the class definition.\n",

        "Using `metaclass` keyword argument (preferred method):\n",
        "\n",

        "- Class decorators: A class decorator is a function that takes a class as input and returns a new class (usually a subclass) with added or modified functionality.
